\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that tackles the challenge laid out in the ``Google Landmark Recognition and Retrieval Challenge."

Google sponsored this challenge in order to help users remember their past trips. Classifying different landmarks from around the world will help Google with labelling the image that the user is looking at and with building a natural language interface to its image database.

In order to solve this challenge, we designed, built, and trained an image classification model to effectively perform the recognition task required to a competitive degree.
