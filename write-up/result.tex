\section{Results}
As discussed in the problem definition, we measure accuracy by the proportion of test-set images correctly classified. (The correct landmark class is the same as the class that the network predicts to be the most likely.) Our fully trained network achieves a test-set accuracy of $87.1\%$. We are satisfied with this accuracy. Our network predicts the correct class nearly seven times for every one time that it makes a mistake. As there are 50 classes, this suggests that our network has learned a lot about classifying landmarks that can generalize to new data. In addition, this accuracy is high enough to be useful in the business context imagined by Google, such as image labelling, retrieval, and targeted advertisement sales.
