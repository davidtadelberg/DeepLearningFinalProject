\section{Results}
As discussed in the problem definition, we measure accuracy by the proportion of test-set images correctly classified. (The correct landmark class is the same as the class that the network predicts to be the most likely.) Our fully trained network achieves a test-set accuracy of X. We are satisfied with this accuracy. Our network predicts the correct class n times for every one time that it makes a mistake. As there are m classes, this suggests that our network performs much better than chance and has learned a lot about classifying landmarks. In addition, this accuracy is high enough to be useful in the business context imagined by Google, such as image labelling, retrieval, and targeted advertisement sales.
