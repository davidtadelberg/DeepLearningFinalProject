\section{Contribution of Team Members}

TODO Need to Ensure Accuracy. All should edit to highlight their impact.

All three members of our team played key roles in this project. David led the first stage of the project, setting up the team GitHub and FloydHub and creating the first version of the neural network. Tommy led the second stage of the project, downloading the large dataset, preprocessing it, and uploading it to FloydHub. Charles led the third stage of the project, modifying the initial architecture and training the network.

In addition, all team members participated in architecting and training the network and applying what we learned in the course. The choices we made are the consensus decisions of the team. David led the discussions that spurred us to base our architecture upon AlexNet and to apply transfer learning to this problem. He also added regularization and dropout to the network, facilitating generalization. Charles takes responsibility for determining how to modify the original AlexNet architecture. Tommy led the decisions to.
